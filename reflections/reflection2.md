## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
We were able to finish the dog search page and favorite features this sprint. We also believe that our demo on Friday went relatively smoothly.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Narrowing down what was an MVP. Thankfully, the TAs were able to assist with that.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished a majority of the tasks that were in our sprint plan for this week. Since we did not finish all of the planned tasks, we wanted to spend some time during the weekend or early in the week to finish any additional tasks.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the past projects were a major help in showing us the process of setting up routes and models for our data functions. We did have some discussion about how to organize and separate our routes, but our current backend structure looks fine.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The quiz feature, again, is more of an add-on feature rather than a core part of our project, so we might not be able to flesh that out as much as we had hoped to. I think as we worked more on the project, we realized that we would rather spend more of our efforts further developing what we have at the moment rather than the quiz.
