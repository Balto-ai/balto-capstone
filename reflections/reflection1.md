## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We have almost half our user stories done, and most of our pages are finished.
On the backend, we are also in good shape for our most frequently used functionalities.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We thought creating so many pages was a lot to keep track of, so sometimes, we need to take a step back and regroup.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished more than 80% of all the issues in our project board this week. For the remaining tasks, we have already gotten a start on them, so we plan to wrap them up by early next week. We tried to be ambitious in pushing as many issues onto the first sprint as we thought possible, so overall, we are happy with the progress we have made.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We found the past labs and projects immensely helpful in referring to best practices for handling the backend (ex. authorization) and giving us the necessary tools to complete the front-end.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 We think the quiz is in danger of being pushed until the last minute. For us, we have a filter and search bar, so the quiz is a nice add-on but not a necessary feature for the users. We hope to push through the last issues next week, and find time to work on these stretch features.
