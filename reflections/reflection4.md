## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We deployed our site, and everything worked as expected!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We were able to get some user feedback from our peers, and they were able to find some issues that we weren’t aware of, so we spent some time going back and addressing them. We also used a lot of different components from different frameworks and packages, and it was a bit of a challenge getting them to work how we wanted them to.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we finished all of our tasks from the sprint plan!

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes! Looking back, the projects were extremely helpful in giving us the fundamentals to execute this project. We used the backbone of React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, but used css libraries like Bootstrap and Material UI and various NPM packages to enhance the responsiveness and functionalities of our app.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We are all happy with the progress we have made. At this point, there aren’t any stories at risk. Users can successfully browse for a dog, select a dog, star a dog, and send an adoption inquiry for the admin to look at.
