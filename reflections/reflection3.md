## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We got our MVP done this week.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges that I’m facing this week is uploading multiple images at the same time. It’s taking some time to figure out how to get the files that the user selected, but I’m almost there!

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to finish nearly all the tasks that we planned for this sprint, but we did not finish pagination on the dog search page. We are planning to finish this up after we deploy our website just to make sure that we have a site to present. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, the past projects were helpful in giving us the baseline skill to implement the backbone of our website. We managed to figure out other features like image uploading and css styling by looking at online resources and tutorials and building on our fundamentals.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The quiz is still on our backlog of stretch features and is not a priority at the moment nor a key feature in our MVP.
