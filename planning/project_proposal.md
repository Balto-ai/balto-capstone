# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Annesa Tran, Christy Xiong, Charles Xu**

## Problem Statement

Our web app aims to increase dog adoption rates from shelters by facilitating the process of training dogs. Many people who want to own dogs are hesitant to adopt because shelter dogs can be more unpredictable in their behavior. Furthermore, senior dogs are often left behind because people are more likely to choose a young puppy. In this way, our web app provides a platform to track dog training progress and match potential dog owners with dogs living in shelters.

## Description

The main purpose of our proposed app is to provide a centralized dashboard to track training progress for dogs and match dog adopters with dogs in the shelter.

It will include progress tracking (including a live feed of achievements and a section including what instructions a dog can or can’t follow), an administrative tool to keep track of dogs under their care, and a platform to help match potential adopters with dog profiles.


## Expected Features List

* A landing page for shelter admins to sign in or create an account
* A form for admins to sign up a dog and enter relevant information
* Forms for admins to input progress 
* A “Dashboard” view of all the dogs under an organization. Each dog would have a profile page that includes pertinent information such as an image, name, age, sex, breed and color, relevant dates, progress
* Ability for shelter administrators to set customized goals for individual dogs.
*Live “Feed” in profile of progress
* Maybe include medical information such as vaccine status and relevant medical procedures

## Open Questions

* We need to discuss the topic of narrowing down our target audience (just shelters looking for an organizational tool or also adopters looking for a dog to care for). This will affect how our routes are structured because users looking to adopt will have a different UX/UI than shelters looking to match dogs to owners.
* Do we want to use an API for the dog training part? Or should we create the training content ourselves? Or should we distance ourselves from the actual training part and just provide the training progress and matching process functionalities?
* What APIs are available that can help with our project?
* What other features might adoption shelters find valuable?
* How should we prioritize features? What will we constitute as a minimum viable product?
* How should we go about creating different user classes with different permissions?
* What specific pages/views will we need (other than the ones we have already identified)?
* How do we implement privacy settings (e.g. if a shelter doesn’t want a particular dog on the platform to be showcased publicly)?
